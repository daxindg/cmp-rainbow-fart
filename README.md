cmp-rainbow-fart is a [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) source that keeps giving you compliment while you are coding. It will check the keywords in your code to play relative sounds.
> Rainbow Fart is a literal translation word from Chinese, which means giving somebody exaggerated compliment that even seems a little fake. It is not connected to any specific group or individuals.

## Setup
```lua
require'cmp'.setup {
  sources = {
    { name = 'rbfart' }
  }
}
```
